Plugin for the [Cuberite](https://cuberite.org) Minecraft server that allows users to generate mazes. Requires WorldEdit to be installed. To generate a maze, select an area using WorldEdit, then invoke the `/mg` command, specifying parameters as needed.

The plugin can also be used through the server console, specifying the world and coords as parameters, rather than reading them from a player's WorldEdit selection.
